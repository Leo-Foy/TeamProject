* As a user of the todo app, I want to be able to mark a task as complete

  * Given that I am logged into the todo app, when I view my tasks, each task should have a "Mark as Complete" button.

  * Given I click on the "Mark as complete" button next to a task, when the button is clicked, the corresponding task should be marked as complete.

  * Given that a task is marked as complete, when I view my list of tasks, the completed tasks should be visually distinguished from the incomplete tasks.

* As a user of the todo app, I want to navigate through different pages of tasks so that I can view and manage tasks beyond the current page.

  * Given that I am viewing a list of tasks, when there are more tasks than can be displayed on one page, a pagination control should be provided to navigate between pages.

  * Given that the pagination controls are available, when I click on the 'Next' button, I should be taken to the next page of tasks.

  * Given that I navigated to the next page, when I am viewing the current page, a 'Previous' button should be available.

  * Given that I am on the first page of tasks, when I view the pagination controls, the 'Previous' button should be disabled/hidden.

  * Given that I am on the last page of tasks, when I view the pagination controls, the 'Next' button should be disabled/hidden.
